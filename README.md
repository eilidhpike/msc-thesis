* Social Development Analysis with Ensemble Learning and Geospatial Techniques

Exploration of the dynamic interplay between resource access, deprivation, and economic activities by utilising ensemble learning techniques and geospatial analysis to predict business distribution within deprived regions, aiding policymakers and urban planners in evidence-based decision-making.

Methodology:

Utilizes ensemble learning algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine) to predict business distribution.
Addresses data imbalance with the ADASYN technique for improved model performance.
Incorporates geospatial weights matrices to capture spatial dependencies.
Introduces clustering methods to uncover hidden data patterns.

Results:

Significant performance enhancements in Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers with ADASYN.
Integration of ensemble techniques with spatial weights matrix and ADASYN improves predictive capabilities.
Highlights the potential benefits of combining complementary methods in social development analysis.

Future Directions:

Explore the application of deep learning algorithms in geospatial analysis.
Reevaluate clustering techniques and model configurations for further optimization.
